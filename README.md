## Description

StadiApp is a simple and intuitive app that lets you explore all the stadiums hosting this year's Club World Cup. View detailed information for each venue, including location, seating capacity, match results with final scores, and direct links to the official FIFA stadium pages. The app integrates Apple Maps so you can easily see where each stadium is located. You can also sort the list alphabetically or by seating capacity for quick navigation. Ideal for football fans and anyone interested in discovering the tournament venues in an organized and accessible way.


## Motivation

This app was created as part of my journey learning SwiftUI and exploring the Apple ecosystem. With a background in JavaScript, I wanted to build something I would enjoy using while improving my skills step by step. The idea came from my curiosity and interest in or how we say it in Argentina FURBO.
